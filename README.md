## Info

Check out this guys for more details about RuboCop [configuration](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration).

## HOW TO

The example of `.rubocop.yml` file, the we consider to use:

```yml
require:
  - rubocop/cop/internal_affairs
  - rubocop-performance
  - rubocop-rspec
  - rubocop-thread_safety
  - rubocop-i18n

inherit_from:
  - .rubocop_todo.yml # optional
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLSDev/mls_rubocop_configs/vX.X.X/.rubocop_general.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLSDev/mls_rubocop_configs/vX.X.X/.rubocop_rspec.yml

AllCops:
  TargetRubyVersion:  RUBY.VERSION # keep me up-to-date
  TargetRailsVersion: RAILS.VERSION # keep me up-to-date
  Exclude:
    - 'db/**/*'
    - 'lib/apidocs/**/*'
    - 'bin/**/*'

```

Dont forget to keep UR `RUBY.VERSION` and `RAILS.VERSION` up-to-date while updating the rubocop.

`vX.X.X` in config links suppose to be version of configs to use latest stable one. Or if U'r brave enough - U can use it directly from `master` branch like 

```yml
inherit_from:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLSDev/mls_rubocop_configs/master/.rubocop_general.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLSDev/mls_rubocop_configs/master/.rubocop_rspec.yml
```

If dont want to keep downloads in your project, just add: 

```bash
.rubocop-https*
```

to `.gitignore` file.
